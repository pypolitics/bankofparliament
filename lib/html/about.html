        <h3><b>About</b></h3>
            <p><b>Bank</b> of Parliament project collates together publicly available sources of data concerning the financial interests of Members of Parliament.</p>

            <p>The sources of data include, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mps">financial interests</a> declared by parliamentarians, government posts, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theipsa.org.uk/mp-costs/other-published-data">expenses claims</a> and records found on the <a target="_blank" href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/search?q">registrar of companies.</a></p>

            <!-- </br> -->

        <!-- <h4><b>Purpose</b></h4> -->
            <p>The purpose of Bank of Parliament, is to automate the overwhelming task of having at your fingertips all publicly available data about all Members of Parliament, in one place. Bank of Parliament was originally conceived as a journalistic tool, to be used to unearth conflicts of interests by analysing the trail of money surrounding a Member of Parliament and providing a starting point for further investigation.</p>

            <p>During development, surrounded by the political climate of 2017, it became glaringly apparent that many leading figures across western politics rarely exist within a vacuum. Their interconnectedness with the private sector, donors and each other drove many aspects of development and greatly widened the scope of the project.</p>

        <!-- </br> -->
        <h3><b>Challenges</b></h3>
            <p><b>Firstly,</b> the entries made in the register of financial interests are written in natural language. For instance, consider:</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 50px;"><i>“I receive £10,000 per quarter.”</i></p>
            <p>Ideally, the data entry process would require the user to input a specific number, rather than infer one. Another variation on the above entry could be:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;"><i>“I receive £40,000, paid quarterly.”</i></p>
            <p>Both, should be calculated to £40,000.</p>
            <p>Consider the following entry:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;"><i>“Diamond necklace received as gift, to the value of £5,000. Donated to charity.”</i></p>
            <p>It’s easy to extract the number 5000, from this text, but without understanding the semantics of the sentence and the context, difficult to calculate a value of 0.</p>

            <!-- </br> -->
            <p><b>The</b> second major challenge was the matching of patchy, misspelt or incomplete company names and people, declared in the register of interests to specific records in companies house, which also contained patchy and incorrect data.</p>

            <p>For instance, a member of parliament declares that “Michael Davis” donated £10,000 to them. No other information is required when declaring an individual's donation, no middle name, date of birth or address. As such, what method should be used to determine that “Michael Davis” is actually, “Sir Mike Davis”, the well known conservative party donor?</p>

            <p>Another difficulty of this kind was developing the logic required to match the following entries to the same record:</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="margin-left: 50px;">RMT</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 50px;">Rail Maritime and Transport Union</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 50px;">Rail Union</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 50px;">RMT UNION</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The answer to all the above challenges was to develop a somewhat effective algorithm to make a best guess at what a value might be or which companies house record is the correct one, supplemented with an ability to manually override incorrect results.</p>

            <p>Incorrect results are found regularly and are either manually patched if awkward enough or incorporated into the standard matching algorithm. This process is continually being refined and improved, but will never be perfect or fully automated one suspects.</p>

            <!-- </br> -->
            <!-- <p><b>Lastly,</b> the challenge of graphically visualising the generated data in an easy to understand way without compromising on detail proved difficult. A decision was made to separate the data into two different scatter plots, one for the register of interests and another for private sector and donor links. This is a </p> -->

        <!-- </br> -->
        <h3><b>Roadmap</b></h3>
            <p>The main areas of future research and development are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="margin-left: 50px;">An investigation into the entries that aren’t registered with companies house, entities such as private members clubs and trade unions. Bank of Parliament knows next to nothing about these entities which donate regularly to Members of Parliament.</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 50px;">The addition of the House of Lords, senior civil servants, Members of the European Parliament, lobbyists and political think tanks and other political figures.</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 50px;">Continuing research into natural language processing and other language related topics such as spell checking and fuzzy logic matching.</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 50px;">The inclusion of voting history, meetings, previous employment, verbal and written statements and committee positions with the intent to highlight any conflict of interest.</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 50px;">Research into the possibility of accessing the land registry to attempt calculate the actual value of declared property holdings.</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 50px;">Research into ascertaining company valuations to convert shareholding percentages into monetary amounts.</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 50px;">Research into machine learning.</li>
            </ul>
