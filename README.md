# notpolitics

Project to pull the financial intrests of british members of parliament from open data sources.

Attempting to gain an overview of each politicians income, wealth, donations and gifts, with a view
to providing british voters a clearer view of potential conflicts of intrests.

Hopefully, some awkward questions will be raised


To run, python notpolitics.py, will download the data the json folder.

An example of a formatting script is included, as well as a script to download images of each member of parliament.

Website front end to come shortly (hopefully), plus better more reliable data parsing.
